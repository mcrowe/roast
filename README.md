# Roast

Immutable, transactional, database in pure Javascript.
Redux compatibile, using ReduxRoast.

## Warning: This library is still experimental.

## TODO
- Extract repo methods into top-level functions (e.g. get(schema, db, table, id))
- Extract Transaction and Repo functionality into separate files
- Remove dependency on lodash
- Release as a proper npm module
- Extract ReduxRoast into its own module?
